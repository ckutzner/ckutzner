# Hello, my name is Camilla.

I am a German-language [copywriter and copy editor](https://www.camilla-kutzner.de). I am also a [singer, composer, explorer of electronic sounds](https://the-emergent.de) and multi-curious creative.

I use Python (and a few other things) to write tools to make my writing/editing life easier, and occasionally also my everyday life. I like to automate the boring stuff and figure out nifty solutions to tedious tasks. It might take me just as long, but it's more fun!

You can find me on the internet in the following places: 

 * ‚úèÔ∏è my [blog about writing & copy-editing](https://www.camilla-kutzner.de/blog)
 * üß† [anders produktiv](https://anders-produktiv.de), my productivity blog for the rest of us
 * ü¶£ [my mastodon profile](https://literatur.social/@ckutzner)
