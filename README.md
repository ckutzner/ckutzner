# Hello, my name is Camilla.

I am a German-language copywriter and copy editor. I am also a [singer, composer, explorer of electronic sounds](https://the-emergent.de) and multi-curious creative.

I use mainly Python to write tools to make my writing/editing life easier, and occasionally also my everyday life. I like to automate the boring stuff and figure out nifty solutions to tedious tasks. It might take me just as long, but it's more fun!

You can find me on the internet in the following places: 

 * my [homepage & blog](https://www.camilla-kutzner.de)
 * [anders produktiv](https://anders-produktiv.de), my productivity blog for the rest of us
 * [my mastodon profile](https://literatur.social/@ckutzner)
